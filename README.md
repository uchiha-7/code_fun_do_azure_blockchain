Idea
I plan to make a secure voting application using Azure Blockchain to replace the existing EVMs being used in the Indian general elections as they can be hacked.
My application would use strong cryptographic hashes to represent the existing vote count of a political party and securely commit changes to it. By using Blockchain, the whole vote count and the tallying process can be made public therby making the elections more transparent.
I will use the "Statistical Hand Book 2017 : Legislature and Election" to analyse the difference between the expected vote count of a political party and the actual vote count of that party. This differnce might me caused by discrepancies in the voting system and through my project I want to remove them.
